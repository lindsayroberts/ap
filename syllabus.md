## Course Description

AP Computer Science Principles offers a multidisciplinary approach to teaching the underlying principles of computation. The course will introduce students to the creative aspects of programming, abstractions, algorithms, large data sets, the Internet, cybersecurity concerns, and computing impacts. AP Computer Science Principles will give students the opportunity to use technology to address real-world problems and build relevant solutions. This course will be taught in Python to prepare students for Programming I, AP Programming II, and Advanced Programming III. Together, these aspects of the course make up a rigorous and rich curriculum that aims to broaden participation in computer science. This course satisfies the technology credit for high school graduation. Students will submit the majority of assignments through MyMCPS Classroom.

## The AP Exam- May 8, 2020

The AP CS Principles assessment has two parts. The first part, during the school year, is a performance assessment consisting of two performances tasks. The second is a summative 74 multiple-choice question exam. The results of each will be used to calculate a final AP score using the 1-5 scale.

The two performance tasks as defined by College Board are:

1. Explore - Implications of Computing Inventions
Students explore a computing innovation of their choice. Students will evaluate its impacts on social, economic, and cultural areas of our lives.
Students will make a computational artifact in the form of a visualization, a graphic, a video, a program, or an audio recording to complete the task. There will also be a series of prompts the students must answer.
2. Create - Applications from Ideas
Students develop a computer program that solves a problem of interest to them. Students are encouraged to work with a partner but it is not required. There will also be a series of prompts the students must answer.
       
Our Vision Statement: to demonstrate creativity, critical thinking, problem solving, and decision making while using technology effectively and productively to provide my students with the skills they need for success in our changing society, in a safe and respectful environment.


## Grading

This course is considered Advanced Level by MCPS, and, as such, will provide a weighted grade. Grades will be calculated according to MCPS and Wootton High School Career and Technology grading policies. This class will operate based on an “all points” format with no weighted categories.

### 50% Rule

To be eligible for the 50% rule, students must attempt to meet the basic requirements for task/assessment.  For this course, a 25% is viewed as attempting to meet the basic requirements.

### Scores on MyMCPS

It is your responsibility to monitor the scores you receive through MyMCPS. If you perceive that an error has been made, you must bring it to my attention within one week of the score's entry in order for me to examine the issue. After one week, there will be no re-examination of the score. This one-week period does not extend beyond the end of any marking period, however.


## Acceptable and Unacceptable Collaboration

The following rules are set forth by the University of Maryland Computer Science Department, and do a good job of describing what is considered cheating in computer programming.

Excerpt from: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jxc/policy.html

The decision as to whether a student has cheated depends on the intent of an assignment, the ground rules specified by the instructor, and the behavior of the student. The following three guidelines help an instructor decide if cheating has occurred:

Program plagiarism will be suspected if an assignment that calls for independent development and implementation of a program results in two or more solutions so similar that one solution can be converted to the other(s) by a series of simple commands.
Cheating will be suspected if a student who completed an assignment cannot explain both the intricacies of the solution and the techniques used to generate that solution.
If you give an assignment to another student OR receive an assignment from another student and hand it in as your own work.

It is unreasonable to expect a complete definition that would cover all cases because each situation is important enough to merit careful, individual scrutiny; however, it is helpful to have guidelines and precedents. As a general rule, if you do not understand what you are handing in, you are probably cheating. If you have given somebody the answer, you are probably cheating. In order to help you draw the line, here are some examples of clear cases of cheating:

### Examples of Cheating:

Turning in someone else's work, in whole or in part, as your own (with or without his/her knowledge).
Turning in a completely duplicated assignment.
Allowing another student to turn in your work as his/her own.
Allowing someone else to examine or copy your code or written assignment, either in draft or final form.
Reviewing files from another student or source, including retyping their files.
Several people writing one assignment and turning in multiple copies, all represented (implicitly or explicitly) as individual work.
Stealing an examination or solution from the instructor or course staff.
Copying from another student during an exam, quiz, or midterm. This includes receiving exam-related information from a student who has already taken the exam, or providing exam-related information to a student who has not yet taken the exam.
On the other hand, we encourage you to discuss the exercises and homework with other students. But the discussion is limited to clarifying the assignments and sketching a general approaches to a solution. You should never look at another person's program to help you write yours, nor allow another student to look at your program. It is important that you do your own work so as to maximize your learning. Here are some examples of acceptable collaboration:

### Examples of Not Cheating:

Turning in work done alone or with the help of the course's staff.
Getting or giving help about using the computers.
Getting or giving help about solving minor syntax errors.
High level discussions of course material for better understanding.
Discussing the code that we give out on the assignment.
Discussing the assignments to better understand them.
Providing assistance with the language, class library, and tools.
We will not condone cheating.


## Due Dates/ Deadlines

The due date for projects is the last in-class day available for students to work. The due date is at the end of the actual CLASS PERIOD in which the student is enrolled.
Students will not be given class time to work on projects after the due date and are expected to come in outside of class to work if they need more time to submit prior to the deadline.   
Submitting a project after the due date but before the deadline will result in a 10% deduction.
Students who have spent any time working on coursework for a different class or otherwise using the class time provided on non-class tasks forfeit the right to turn in an assignment after the due date and forfeit the opportunity to work in any of our computer labs during non-class time.
Any project not submitted by the deadline will result in a score of zero unless there are extenuating circumstances, such as extended excused absences.

### Homework
The due date for homework is the start of the class period during which the assignment is due.
The deadline for homework is the same as the due date.  No late homework will be accepted for credit.  Any homework submitted after the due date/deadline will result in a score of zero.
 

## Re-teaching / Reassessment

Re-teaching occurs when the teacher or student determines that students are not meeting learning goals.  Reassessment opportunities are identified by the teacher before the original task/assessment and occur within an instructional unit.  Only one reassessment opportunity is offered per task/assessment.  When tasks/assignments are reassessed, they may be reassessed partially, entirely, or in a different format, as determined by the teacher.

The following assessments/tasks that indicate a final measure of learning may not be reassessed:

End of course semester exams
Assessments that end an instructional unit or period of study
Final research papers, reports, or essays
Culminating projects or performances
 
When reassessment is offered, all students may be reassessed, regardless of grade on original task/assessment if they meet the following requirements:  complete the original task or assessment, completed required assignments, and complete re-teaching/relearning activities as determined by the teacher.

 
## Other Expectations

Students are expected to spend class time focused on the materials for this class. This includes materials found online.
This classroom is a place where all students should feel comfortable and secure. No hate speech of any kind will be tolerated.
Students are expected to attend class in a timely manner. 
 

## Absences

Students who are absent (excused) on the day of a quiz or test are expected to email or speak with me on the day they are absent or the morning before school when they return.
Students who are absent (excused) on a due date are expected to turn in an assignment the next day they are in school. If the student has missed several work days, s/he must email or speak with me on the day they are absent or the morning before school when they return to work out an amended due date.
In the case of unexcused absences:
Missed Quizzes and Tests may NOT be counted for credit - resulting in a score of 0.
Assignments submitted after the official due date will be counted late.
Students must notify their teacher three days prior to leaving on a field trip. 
Students who have field trip related absences for multiple days will meet to discuss their assignments with their teacher ahead of time.
 

## Availability

I am available mornings by appointment made at least one day in advance (i.e. the day before) and the last 20 minutes of lunch in Room 15 each day. I am available during lunch in room 109b by appointment as well. Students MAY NOT eat in the lab during lunch. I am also happy to answer questions sent via email if you are working on something while not in the lab with me.

 

# Computer Science Labs Rules and Regulations

The computer lab is for Instructional use only!  You are responsible for your assigned computer station (hardware, software, and immediate vicinity) while you are in class.

This means that any problem found on, near, or within your work area will be attributed to you.  To prevent being accused of something you did not do report any problems found at the start of class or as soon as discovered.
You will be assigned a specific computer for your use only.
Students will not eat or drink in the Computer Science classrooms.
At the end of each period all networked computers must be logged-off so that the main sign in screen is visible.  This helps to protect the integrity of your work and is an essential part of working in the lab.
Removal of software, hardware, or software documentation from the school is prohibited.
Students are only to work in approved applications and/or print materials when permission to do so has been granted.
Workstation areas must be kept clean and tidy at all times.  Leave your area litter free.
The following are strictly prohibited:
Tampering with Hardware/software
Obscene or inappropriate messages, filenames, etc.
Unauthorized saving of files to unauthorized network or hard drives
Unauthorized downloading of material
Internet use is a privilege, not a right.
Adhere to all rules in the Computer Science section of the Agenda Book.
## Note:  Failure to comply with any of the above rules and regulations may result in disciplinary action, including removal from the class on a temporary or permanent basis.
